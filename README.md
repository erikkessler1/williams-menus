# Eph Menus
iOS app for viewing Williams College dining hall menus.
Created by Erik Kessler, 2015.

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to improve the dining hall menu viewing experience for Williams College students as the college's solution is frustratingly slow and cumbersome which makes it hard to quickly check the current menus.

## Details
Nightly, the web scraper gathers menu data for breakfast, lunch, and dinner at each dining hall and stores it as a JSON object to serve to serve to iOS clients. This allows us to quickly provide the pre-gathered menu data to clients where the client can display it to users in a more intuitive, native format and even store the data for offline use.

## Update
The school's menu website has changed the format of its data. Thus, this app no longer works.
